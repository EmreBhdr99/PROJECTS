The Dogs vs. Cats dataset is a common computer vision dataset in which pictures are classified as either including a dog or a cat.

After the dataset is well studied, it can be used to understand and practice how to design, evaluate, and apply convolutional neural networks for image classification.

You will build a classifier with images and try to detect dogs versus cats using CNN.

Train set includes 12500 cat-5026 dog images, validation set includes 1219 cat-1071 dog images and test set includes 6897 cat and dogs images together.
